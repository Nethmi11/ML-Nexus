I have a text extractor, to extract texts from images of any extension(png, jpg, jpeg, etc).
I have done this using two different approaches :

1. PyTesseract: It is a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine.
   It's widely used for text extraction from clear, high-quality images.
   PyTesseract works well with images where the text is easily distinguishable from the background.
   
   Key Features:
    - Works best with clear, high-contrast images.
    - Good for images with clean and well-spaced text.
    - Simple and fast for high-quality documents.
      
2. EasyOCR : It is a deep learning-based OCR library that supports over 80 languages.
   Itâ€™s great for noisy, low-quality images where PyTesseract may struggle.
   EasyOCR uses more advanced algorithms, making it better at handling blurry text, noisy backgrounds, and images with distorted or handwritten text.
   
   Key Features:
   - Works better on noisy or complex images.
   - Supports multiple languages and scripts.
   - Handles skewed, rotated, and non-uniform text layout better.
   - Can extract text from both printed and handwritten sources.
