# Image Autoregressive Modeling: A Unified Perspective

## What is Image Autoregressive Modeling?

Image autogressive modeling is a technique in machine learning that generates images by predicting the next pixel or token in an image sequentially. The model is trained to predict each pixel or token conditioned on the previous ones, making it inherently a step-by-step, sequential process. This approach is called "autoregressive" because it uses its own prior predictions to inform future predictions.

In the context of image generation, the goal of an autoregressive model is to learn how to generate high-quality images by modeling the distribution of pixel values or image features in a way that each successive part of the image is predicted from previously generated parts.

### The Key Idea:
Autoregressive models generate images by conditioning each prediction on the preceding context. For images, this can be pixels (in pixel-space autoregressive models) or abstract latent space representations (in latent-space autoregressive models). By modeling the pixel or latent space distribution, these models can generate realistic and high-fidelity images.

## Stabilizing Latent Space for Image Autoregressive Modeling

### Key Features:
- **Latent Space Representation**:  performs next-token prediction in an abstract latent space derived from self-supervised learning models like DINOv2. Instead of predicting pixels directly, it predicts tokens in a more compact and informative latent space, leading to faster convergence and better image quality.
  
- **Novel Tokenization via K-Means**: By applying K-Means clustering on the hidden states of the DINOv2 model, creates a discrete tokenizer. This novel method boosts the performance of image generation tasks, especially on the ImageNet dataset.

- **State-of-the-art Performance**: The model achieves remarkable results, including an FID score of **4.59 for class-unconditional tasks** and **3.39 for class-conditional tasks** on ImageNet, as well as a top-1 accuracy of **80.3** in linear-probe image classification tasks.

### Applications:
It is not limited to image generation; its robust latent-space representation can also enhance image understanding. It can be applied to tasks like:
- **Class-Unconditional Image Generation**: Generate diverse images without specific class labels.
- **Class-Conditional Image Generation**: Generate images conditioned on a particular class (e.g., generating images of cats or dogs).
- **Image Understanding**: Achieve state-of-the-art performance in image classification tasks.

## Experimental Results

### Performance Metrics:
- **Class-Unconditional Image Generation**: It demonstrates excellent FID and IS (Inception Score) scores compared to previous models. For example, it achieves an FID score of **4.59** and an IS of **141.29** for class-unconditional tasks.
- **Class-Conditional Image Generation**: It  also outperforms many models on class-conditional tasks, achieving an FID score of **3.39** for ImageNet at 256x256 resolution.

### Linear-Probe Accuracy:
It achieves a top-1 accuracy of **80.3%** when fine-tuned on ImageNet, surpassing many previous autoregressive models and demonstrating the model's ability to capture detailed image features effectively.

## Conclusion

It is an innovative model that combines the power of self-supervised learning with autoregressive modeling in latent space. By stabilizing the latent space through novel tokenization methods and leveraging the DINOv2 model, it improves both image generation quality and understanding, making it a significant advancement in the field of generative models.
