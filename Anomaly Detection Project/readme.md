# Anomaly Detection Project

This project demonstrates how to detect anomalies (unusual patterns) in a dataset using machine learning techniques like **Isolation Forest** and **KMeans Clustering**. The goal is to identify anomalous behaviors that could indicate fraudulent transactions, network intrusions, or other forms of outliers.

## Project Overview

This project uses **supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques** to identify anomalies in a given dataset. The anomaly detection process involves:

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Gathering and cleaning data by handling missing values and outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data distributions, identifying potential anomalies, and calculating summary statistics.
3. **Anomaly Detection Techniques**: Using **KMeans clustering** and **Isolation Forest** to detect anomalies.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model performance with metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score (if ground truth labels are available).
5. **Visualization**: Visualizing the anomalies detected using **PCA** and other plots.

## Files and Their Purpose

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each script in the project:

1. **`data_preprocessing.py`**:
   - Handles data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing tasks.
   - Deals with missing values, categorical data encoding, and outlier handling.

2. **`eda_visualizations.py`**:
   - Performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
   - Visualizes the data distributions and detects potential anomalies through visual methods like histograms and scatter plots.

3. **`kmeans_anomaly_detection.py`**:
   - Implements anomaly detection using **KMeans clustering**.
   - Identifies outliers based on clustering results.

4. **`isolation_forest_anomaly_detection.py`**:
   - Implements anomaly detection using the **Isolation Forest** algorithm.
   - Detects anomalies by isolating points that are far from the rest of the data.
   - Allows you to adjust `contamination` and `max_samples` parameters.

5. **`model_evaluation.py`** (Optional):
   - Evaluates the performance of anomaly detection techniques (if ground truth labels are available).
   - Calculates precision, recall, F1 score, and other evaluation metrics.

6. **`anomalies_report.py`**:
   - Generates a report of the detected anomalies, which can be saved to a CSV or viewed as a summary.

7. **`Anomaly_Detection_Project.ipynb`**:
   - Jupyter notebook that integrates all the scripts above.
   - Contains code, visualizations, and detailed explanations for the entire anomaly detection process.

## Installation Instructions

### Clone this repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Anomaly-Detection-Project.git
cd Anomaly-Detection-Project
```

### Install dependencies
This project requires Python 3.x. You can install the required libraries using **pip** by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not included, you can manually install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib
```

## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Run the `data_preprocessing.py` script to preprocess the raw data. This will clean the data, handle missing values, and normalize it for anomaly detection:

```bash
python data_preprocessing.py
```

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Run the `eda_visualizations.py` script to visualize the data distributions and identify potential anomalies:

```bash
python eda_visualizations.py
```

### Step 3: Anomaly Detection with KMeans
Use **KMeans** to detect anomalies by running the `kmeans_anomaly_detection.py` script:

```bash
python kmeans_anomaly_detection.py
```

### Step 4: Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest
Use **Isolation Forest** to detect anomalies by running the `isolation_forest_anomaly_detection.py` script. Adjust parameters like `contamination` and `max_samples` as needed.

```bash
python isolation_forest_anomaly_detection.py
```

### Step 5: Model Evaluation (Optional)
If you have ground truth labels, run `model_evaluation.py` to evaluate the performance of the anomaly detection models:

```bash
python model_evaluation.py
```

### Step 6: Generate Anomalies Report
Run the `anomalies_report.py` script to generate and save a report of detected anomalies:

```bash
python anomalies_report.py
```

### Step 7: Jupyter Notebook Workflow
Run the entire workflow within a Jupyter notebook for better visualization and step-by-step execution. Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Anomaly_Detection_Project.ipynb
```

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning models (KMeans and Isolation Forest).
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization.
- `seaborn`: For enhanced data visualizations.
- `joblib`: For saving and loading models.

You can install all dependencies with the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Explanation

- **KMeans Clustering**: This unsupervised learning algorithm groups data points into clusters. Points that do not belong to any well-defined cluster are considered anomalies.
- **Isolation Forest**: This tree-based algorithm isolates anomalies by randomly selecting a feature and splitting the data. Anomalous points are those that are isolated more quickly than normal points.

## Results and Visualizations

The results of the anomaly detection process are visualized in several ways:

1. **PCA Visualizations**: The results of the anomaly detection models (KMeans and Isolation Forest) are visualized using PCA (Principal Component Analysis), which reduces the dimensionality of the data to 2D for easy visualization.
2. **Anomaly Distribution**: The distribution of detected anomalies is shown using scatter plots and heatmaps.
