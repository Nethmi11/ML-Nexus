## Introduction

In an increasingly competitive job market, predicting college placement success is valuable for students, colleges, and recruiters. This model leverages multiple machine learning algorithms to forecast placement outcomes based on academic performance, demographic data, and extracurricular involvement.

## Problem Statement

Predicting college placements accurately is challenging due to:
- **Variety of Influencing Factors**: Academic scores, previous experience, and other personal characteristics affect placement outcomes.
- **Data Quality**: Differences in available data for each student can affect model accuracy.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identifying key predictive factors is crucial for improving the modelâ€™s performance.

This project addresses these challenges by building a model that leverages various attributes of student profiles to predict their placement likelihood.

## Solution Overview

The model is built using several machine learning algorithms, including:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

Key steps in the project include:
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical data.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and refining features to enhance model accuracy.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training multiple models and comparing their performance to select the best one for predicting placements.

## Data

The dataset includes features like:
- **Academic Performance**: Grades, test scores, and other academic achievements.
- **Demographic Information**: Age, gender, and location.
- **Extracurriculars and Skills**: Involvement in projects, certifications, and relevant skills.

Data should be placed in the `data/` directory in CSV format.
