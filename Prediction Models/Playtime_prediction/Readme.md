# Playtime Classification with Logistic Regression

## Project Overview

This project employs a logistic regression model to classify playtime data into predefined categories. By analyzing features such as session length, frequency of play, and user demographics, the model helps predict user engagement levels. This insight can be valuable for game developers and analysts to enhance user retention and engagement strategies.

## Problem Statement

Understanding player engagement patterns is crucial in the gaming industry to personalize experiences and optimize retention. This project addresses the need for a predictive model that can classify users based on playtime data, supporting data-driven decisions in game development and marketing.

## Features

The dataset contains several key attributes:
- **Session Length**: Duration of each gaming session.
- **Frequency of Play**: How often users play.
- **Demographic Details**: Information such as age and region.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess data, including handling missing values and feature scaling.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and engineering relevant features for the model.
3. **Model Training**: Train a logistic regression model on the dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
