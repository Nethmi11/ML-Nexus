# Avocado Price Prediction with Machine Learning Models

This project predicts the average price of avocados across different regions in the United States using various machine learning models, including a Keras-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) are employed to uncover trends and improve model performance.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing**: Data loading, cleaning, and encoding of categorical variables.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization of trends and outliers using seaborn and matplotlib.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of multiple models (KNN, SVC, Decision Tree, ANN).
- **Evaluation**: Comparing model performance and tuning hyperparameters for optimal results.

## Models Used

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
2. **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**
3. **Decision Tree Classifier**
4. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** - Developed using Keras for deep learning.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Keras (TensorFlow backend)
