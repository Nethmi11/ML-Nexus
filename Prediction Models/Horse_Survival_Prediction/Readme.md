# Horse Survival Prediction

## Project Overview
The Horse Survival Prediction project leverages machine learning models to predict the likelihood of survival in horses based on clinical data and various health indicators. This tool is intended to support veterinarians and animal care facilities by providing insights into the probable outcomes of medical interventions, enabling more informed and timely decisions.

## Problem Statement
Predicting the survival of horses after medical intervention remains challenging due to numerous health variables and varying responses to treatments. Traditional assessments rely heavily on clinical experience and subjective judgement. This project aims to use machine learning for more accurate predictions, creating a reliable tool for risk assessment and decision-making in equine care.

## Features
- Implements multiple machine learning models, including:
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Tree
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Provides survival predictions based on health and clinical data
- Model evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, and recall

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of historical clinical records of horses, which includes various health indicators and survival outcomes.
